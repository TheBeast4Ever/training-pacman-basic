# Pac-Man
Yet another Pac-Man game implementation using no additional libraries, just the JDK.

The game is controlled by a finite-state machine with states INTRO, READY, HUNTING, CHANGING_LEVEL, PACMAN_DYING, GHOST_DYING, GAME_OVER. The user interface is decoupled from the game controller by an interface. A Swing implementation of this interface is provided.
